SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea
The proposed solution is an advanced Interview Management System (IMS) that simulates a real-life Board Room experience for both interviewers and candidates. The system will facilitate structured interviews, provide relevant questions based on the candidate's expertise, and evaluate responses quantitatively. The goal is to enhance the objectivity and effectiveness of the recruitment process.

## Use Cases
Candidate Registration

Candidates can register and create profiles, including their expertise and experience.
Interview Scheduling

Admins can schedule interviews and assign interviewers based on expertise.
Question Generation

The system generates relevant questions based on the candidate's profile and the position applied for.
Conducting Interviews

Interviewers can conduct interviews in a virtual boardroom setting, using the system to ask questions and record responses.
Scoring and Evaluation

The system evaluates the relevance of questions and candidate responses, providing a quantifiable score.
